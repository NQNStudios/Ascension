	<Text>On the day you turn 16, your parents take you to get your first aug.</Text>
	<Text>Driving to the clinic, you distract yourself from the nervous anticipation by gazing out the window.</Text>

	<Text>Your parents outline the choices. Because you are still young, your first augs will be completely temporary and must be replaced as you grow.</Text>
	<Text>Your mother encourages you to try mental augmentation - you can optimize your internal processing by placing a microchip in your cranium to interface with your brain. This seems dangerous, but she assures you the tech has been well tested and is quite safe.</Text>
	<Text>Your father suggests a simple strength enhancement. They will use nanobots to boost your muscles' strength and efficiency.</Text>
	<Text>As an afterthought, they mention the agility aug. You can increase your reaction time, coordination and speed. Your parents aren't sure why you would want these acrobatic advantages.</Text>
